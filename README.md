# Harmonagon
The Harmonagon™ is a web app that uses simple geometric shapes to teach music to anyone, anywhere, for free.

The Harmonagon™ tradename is an amalgam of the words harmony and polygon.

The app is primarily designed as a learning and practice tool for music students and musicians, 
but anyone can use it, including beginners and those without an instrument.

The Harmonagon can identify and play more the 2,500 chords and scales.
